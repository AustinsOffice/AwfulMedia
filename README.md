# AwfulMedia V3.0

Back again with a completely new website. This time around, AwfulMedia doesn't try to be anything it isn't. I have a place for my blog, I place to host my asset downloads, and a place to tell you about myself.

That's all I need... for now.

## Tools
Built on the [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) framework. [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass), [Bootstrap 3.x](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt), and about 4 gallons of coffee.
